                    <br><br>
                    <h3>birth of city pop</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>City pop is a musical genre that appeared in the late seventies in Japan, mostly due to the nascent economic boom.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Inspired by occidental influences, the genre include initially other genres like album rock, soft rock, RnB, funk and boogie. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Its esthetics is at the origin based on the beauty of japanese cities, the fancy, the current japanese and occidental fashion. </p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class="pictures" src="./View/Assets/index images/80s_pictures.svg" alt="">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h3>Golden age</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The genre is mostly caracterized by urban or tropical melodies, sang in japanese, in a state of mind of joy and idleness.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>City pop nows his golden age during the eightees when it becomes the most popular regional genre with artists like Tatsuro Yamashita, Mariya Takeuchi or Haruomi Hosono.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class="pictures" src="./View/Assets/index images/80s_albums.svg" alt="">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <h3>Initial death</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The end of the eighties brings with it a decline of the genre.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>City pop becomes outdated and is considered as cheesy, mainstream and disposable.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <h3>Then</h3>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <h3>The 2010's came</h3>
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <h3>Rebirth</h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The 2010’s brings with it a new aesthetic trend, the AESTHETIC.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class="pictures" src="./View/Assets/index images/aesthetic_pictures.svg" alt="">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <p>Rooted in a fantasy vision of the past, this new aesthetic exaggerates its codes and tranforms it to create a new proper aesthetic.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Based on an assumed second degree, aesthetic codes counterbalance the coeval trends, using flashy and pastel colors, then, blending 
                        it with kitsch aesthetics. The goal is to make us feel nostalgic about a time that never existed.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The cheesy is now trendy.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Initially a niche aesthetic, it became more and more popular, collecting retro anime codes, massively popularised by Twitter and TikTok.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Several musical genre were born due to this internet cultural boom : Vaporwave, Synthwave, Seapunk and many others, resuming former, cheesy musical 
                        codes to create a new whole genre. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And a trend playing with cheesy codes was not going to forget City Pop.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Old 80’ city pop is then splitted in two sub genres : Vaporwave and Future Funk</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The first one is caracterized by an extremely slow tempo, cloudy synth riffs and a dreamlike / nostalgic vibe. Vaporwave is closer to meme culture than its sibling.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class="pictures" src="./View/Assets/index images/vaporwave_pictures.svg" alt="">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <p>The second one consists on mostly citypop classics remixed with american funk instrumentals, the tempo is often faster than the original songs, giving a more festive vibe, but with the 
                        nostalgic atmosphere specific to the aesthetic. A lot of base songs are remixed and sampled in multiple Future Funk songs.</p>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class="pictures" src="./View/Assets/index images/futurefunk_pictures.svg" alt="">
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <p>One of the best exemple is Flyday Chinatown by Yasuha, that you can retrieve in FIGHT! by Aests, Memory Lane by AcesToAces or Nagoya Streets Melody by Android Apartment.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>City pop still has great days ahead of it. Musicians keeps creating and developing it’s legacy and original songs are trendy again. Let’s see what the future reserves to it !</p>
